# curricular-complexity-notebook
This is the Jupyter Notebook that I used for my curricular complexity analysis.

Unfortunately, because of FERPA issues, I cannot provide the data that is meant to be run with this file at this time. With luck, I can obtain some dummy data in the future that I can include with this repository.
